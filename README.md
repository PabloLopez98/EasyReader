Easy Reader is a productivity tool for studying that resulted out of a 3 day hackathon in which I tasked myself to learn how to build a chrome extension, as well as how to use the realtime database (Firebase). This project contains the following features:

- Add notes to the website for future viewing.
- Share notes with another email, who may view the notes by going onto the same article.
- Block out surrounding content on a site, focus only on text being read.
- Enable computer to read text aloud.
- Highlight text.
- Delete notes.
- Change background color.
